# Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Model

## Overview

The **Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Model** is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This project uses logistic regression to analyze various behavioral and developmental indicators, providing valuable insights to support early detection and intervention. The tool can assist healthcare professionals, educators, and caregivers in making informed decisions about diagnosis and care.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling:** Uses logistic regression to calculate the probability of ASD based on input indicators.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Analyzes behavioral and developmental data to identify patterns associated with ASD.
- **Early Intervention Support:** Facilitates early detection to aid timely intervention and support.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for data input and results interpretation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the logistic regression model.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Joblib:** For saving and loading models.
